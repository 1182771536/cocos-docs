## About Cocos2d-x

Cocos2d-x is an open source game engine under MIT license, and it allows developers to exploit their existing C++, Lua and Javascript knowledge for cross-platform deployment into iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Mac OS X, Windows Desktop, Linux and web, saving time, effort and cost. Cocos2d-x is fast, easy to use and loaded with powerful features.

Our vision is to create a complete toolchain for developing multi-platform games from rapid prototyping to a finished high performing game.

## Facebook Integration for Cocos2d-x

After working very closely with Facebook during four months, Cocos2d-x family announced the full featured Facebook Integration directly in the engine. This coorporation between Facebook and Cocos2d-x have brought a huge opportunity for game developers who want to integrate Facebook functionality into their games. With a single code base, they can release on iOS and Android. Furthermore, with only a few setups, developers will be able to start developing with Facebook APIs, no need to download any additional SDKs or plugins.

In addition, we strongly recommend you Cocos2d-JS, the JavaScript branch of Cocos2d-x family, it's composed by a native engine based on Cocos2d-x JavaScript Bindings and a web engine based on html5. Therefore, you will be able to release fully cross-platform games across iOS, Android and web using simplified JavaScript friendly API to achieve whatever you want to do with Facebook platform.

At the current stage, Cocos2d-JS have released Facebook Integration v1.0 with polished and stabilized APIs while Cocos2d-x released a beta version of Facebook Integration because the cpp/lua API should still be polished to fit the needs of targeted developers.

## Cross platform ability

The cross platform gene is planted in Cocos2d-x from day one.

Cocos2d-x engine provides a consistent development experience for whichever platform you want to distribute to. "Code once, run everywhere" is incredibly easy and natural in Cocos2d-x. This will bring your game great opportunities in almost all channels of distribution. Cocos2d-JS expand this ability to web platform, it supports all major desktop and mobile browsers. All platforms, no matter web or native, uses exactly the same JavaScript API.

This ability is equally considered for designing Facebook Integration from the beginning, so all platforms share exactly the same API reference for Facebook Integration. With Cocos2d-x workflow, the development experience is also highly unified.
