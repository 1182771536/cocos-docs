# Facebook Integration for Cocos2d Overview

The family of Cocos2d including Cocos2d-x, Cocos2d-Lua and Cocos2d-JS is an open source game engine under MIT license. It allows developers to exploit their existing C++, Lua and Javascript knowledge for cross-platform deployment into iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Mac OS X, Windows Desktop and Linux, saving time, effort and cost. Cocos2d is fast, easy to use and loaded with powerful features.

The structure of Cocos2d family is mainly composed with the following products:

- Cocos2d-x, the main Cocos2d engine with Cocos2d-Lua embeded in.
- Cocos2d-JS, JavaScript version engine includes a native engine based on Cocos2d-x JavaScript Bindings and a web engine based on html5.
- Cocos Code IDE, an IDE for debugging Lua/JS scripts running with Cocos2d-x.
- Cocos Studio, an GUI editor for producing efficiently UI layers and animations.

Our vision is to create a complete toolchain for developing multi-platform games from rapid prototyping to a finished high performing game.

## Facebook Integration for Cocos2d

After working very closely with Facebook during four months, Cocos2d family announced the full featured Facebook Integration directly in the engine. This coorporation between Facebook and Cocos2d have brought a huge opportunity for game developers who want to integrate Facebook functionality into their games. With a single code base, they can release on iOS and Android. Furthermore, with only a few setups, developers will be able to start developing with Facebook APIs, no need to download any additional SDKs or plugins.

In addition, the JavaScript branch of Cocos2d family - Cocos2d-JS gives you the ability to release fully cross-platform games across iOS, Android and web. You will be using simplified JavaScript friendly APIs to achieve whatever you want to do with Facebook platform.

At the current stage, Cocos2d-JS have released Facebook Integration v1.0 with polished and stabilized APIs while Cocos2d-x released a beta version of Facebook Integration because the API should still be reviewed to fit the needs of targeted developers.

## Cross platform ability

The cross platform gene is planted in Cocos2d-x from day one.

Cocos2d-x engine provides a consistent development experience for whichever platform you want to distribute to. "Code once, run everywhere" is incredibly easy and natural in Cocos2d-x. This will bring your game great opportunities in almost all channels of distribution. Cocos2d-JS expand this ability to web platform, it supports all major desktop and mobile browsers. All platforms, no matter web or native, uses exactly the same JavaScript APIs.

This ability is equally considered for designing Facebook Integration from the beginning, so all platforms share exactly the same API reference for Facebook Integration. With Cocos2d workflow, the development experience is also highly unified.
