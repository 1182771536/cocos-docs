# Facebook Integration for Cocos2d-JS Overview

Cocos2d-JS is Cocos2d-x engine's JavaScript version that includes a web engine based on html5 and a native engine based on Cocos2d-x JavaScript Bindings. It equips your game with cross-browser and cross-platform abilities, accompanied by full Cocos2d-x features and simplified JavaScript friendly APIs.

## Facebook Integration for Cocos2d-JS

After working very closely with Facebook during four months, Cocos2d-JS v3.1 is coming with the full featured Facebook Integration v1.0 directly in the engine. This coorporation between Facebook and Cocos2d-JS have brought a huge opportunity for game developers who want to integrate Facebook functionality into their games. With a single JavaScript code base, they can release fully cross-platform games across web, iOS and Android. Furthermore, with only a few setups, developers will be able to start developing with Facebook APIs, no need to download any additional SDKs or plugins.

## Cross platform ability

The cross platform gene is planted in Cocos2d-JS from day one.

In the first version of Cocos2d-JS, we reinvented workflows for all platforms, it provides a consistent development experience for whichever platform you want to distribute to, no matter web and native. "Code once, run everywhere" is incredibly easy and natural in Cocos2d-JS. This will bring your game great opportunities in almost all channels of distribution. This graph below shows the Cocos2d-JS cross platform architecture:

This ability is equally considered for designing Facebook Integration from the beginning, so all platforms share exactly the same API reference for Facebook Integration. With Cocos2d-JS workflow, the development experience is also highly unified.
