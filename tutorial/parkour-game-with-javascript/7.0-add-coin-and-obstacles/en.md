# Add Coin and Obstacles Into Our Game

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will try to add Coin and Obstacles into our parkour game.

Thus our player can collect the coin when he is running and he will die when he collide with the obstacle.

We will also cover how to design a game level with tiled map editor. Since the game logic is a little bit complex than before,
so we will refactor the code when we are adding new game components.
