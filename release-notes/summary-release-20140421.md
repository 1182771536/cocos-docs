## What Is It?
If you are a Cocos2d-x Lua/JavaScript engineer, are you satisfied with:

* Typing character by character.
* Debuging by adding a lot of logs.
* Checking the result by restarting game again and again.
* ...

No, certainly not!
Now we are so happy to announce that Cocos Code IDE beta is released!

Using this IDE, you can edit code with a **smart editor**, **debug lua and javascript**, **hot swapping** script files without restarting game, and so on.

Hope it can help you.
